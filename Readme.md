# emailjs [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/eleith/emailjs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/eleith/emailjs)

send emails, html and attachments (files, streams and strings) from node.js to any smtp server

## INSTALLING

	npm install emailjs

## FEATURES
 - works with SSL and TLS smtp servers
 - supports smtp authentication ('PLAIN', 'LOGIN', 'CRAM-MD5', 'XOAUTH2')
 - emails are queued and the queue is sent asynchronously
 - supports sending html emails and emails with multiple attachments (MIME)
 - attachments can be added as strings, streams or file paths
 - supports utf-8 headers and body

## REQUIRES
 - auth access to an SMTP Server
 - if your service (ex: gmail) uses two-step authentication, use an application specific password

## EXAMPLE USAGE - text only emails

```javascript
var email 	= require("./path/to/emailjs/email");
var server 	= email.server.connect({
   user:    "username",
   password:"password",
   host:    "smtp.your-email.com",
   ssl:     true
});

// send the message and get a callback with an error or details of the message that was sent
server.send({
   text:    "i hope this works",
   from:    "you <username@your-email.com>",
   to:      "someone <someone@your-email.com>, another <another@your-email.com>",
   cc:      "else <else@your-email.com>",
   subject: "testing emailjs"
}, function(err, message) { console.log(err || message); });
```

## EXAMPLE USAGE - html emails and attachments

```javascript
var email 	= require("./path/to/emailjs/email");
var server 	= email.server.connect({
   user:	"username",
   password:"password",
   host:	"smtp.your-email.com",
   ssl:		true
});

var message	= {
   text:	"i hope this works",
   from:	"you <username@your-email.com>",
   to:		"someone <someone@your-email.com>, another <another@your-email.com>",
   cc:		"else <else@your-email.com>",
   subject:	"testing emailjs",
   attachment:
   [
      {data:"<html>i <i>hope</i> this works!</html>", alternative:true},
      {path:"path/to/file.zip", type:"application/zip", name:"renamed.zip"}
   ]
};

// send the message and get a callback with an error or details of the message that was sent
server.send(message, function(err, message) { console.log(err || message); });

// you can continue to send more messages with successive calls to 'server.send',
// they will be queued on the same smtp connection

// or you can create a new server connection with 'email.server.connect'
// to asynchronously send individual emails instead of a queue
```

## EXAMPLE USAGE - sending through hotmail/outlook

```javascript
var email 	= require("./path/to/emailjs/email");
var server 	= email.server.connect({
   user:	"username",
   password:"password",
   host:	"smtp-mail.outlook.com",
   tls: {ciphers: "SSLv3"}
});

var message	= {
   text:	"i hope this works",
   from:	"you <username@outlook.com>",
   to:		"someone <someone@your-email.com>, another <another@your-email.com>",
   cc:		"else <else@your-email.com>",
   subject:	"testing emailjs",
   attachment:
   [
      {data:"<html>i <i>hope</i> this works!</html>", alternative:true},
      {path:"path/to/file.zip", type:"application/zip", name:"renamed.zip"}
   ]
};

// send the message and get a callback with an error or details of the message that was sent
server.send(message, function(err, message) { console.log(err || message); });
```

## EXAMPLE USAGE - attaching and embedding an image

```javascript
var email 	= require("./path/to/emailjs/email");
var server 	= email.server.connect({
   user:	"username",
   password:"password",
   host:	"smtp-mail.outlook.com",
   tls: {ciphers: "SSLv3"}
});

var message	= {
   text:	"i hope this works",
   from:	"you <username@outlook.com>",
   to:		"someone <someone@your-email.com>, another <another@your-email.com>",
   cc:		"else <else@your-email.com>",
   subject:	"testing emailjs",
   attachment:
   [
      {data: "<html>i <i>hope</i> this works! here is an image: <img src='cid:my-image' width='100' height ='50'> </html>"},
      {path:"path/to/file.zip", type:"application/zip", name:"renamed.zip"},
      {path:"path/to/image.jpg", type:"image/jpg", headers:{"Content-ID":"<my-image>"}}
   ]
};

// send the message and get a callback with an error or details of the message that was sent
server.send(message, function(err, message) { console.log(err || message); });
```


# API

## email.server.connect(options)

	// options is an object with the following keys
	options =
	{
		user 		// username for logging into smtp
		password // password for logging into smtp
		host		// smtp host
		port		// smtp port (if null a standard port number will be used)
		ssl		// boolean or object {key, ca, cert, rejectUnauthorized} (if true or object, ssl connection will be made)
		tls		// boolean or object (if true or object, starttls will be initiated)
		timeout	// max number of milliseconds to wait for smtp responses (defaults to 5000)
		domain	// domain to greet smtp with (defaults to os.hostname)
    authentication // array of preferred authentication methods ('PLAIN', 'LOGIN', 'CRAM-MD5', 'XOAUTH2')
		logger // override the built-in logger (useful for e.g. Azure Function Apps, where console.log doesn't work)
	}

## email.server.send(message, callback)

	// message can be a smtp.Message (as returned by email.message.create)
	// or an object identical to the first argument accepted by email.message.create

	// callback will be executed with (err, message)
	// either when message is sent or an error has occurred

## message

	// headers is an object ('from' and 'to' are required)
	// returns a Message object

	// you can actually pass more message headers than listed, the below are just the
	// most common ones you would want to use

	headers =
	{
		text		// text of the email
		from		// sender of the format (address or name <address> or "name" <address>)
		to			// recipients (same format as above), multiple recipients are separated by a comma
		cc			// carbon copied recipients (same format as above)
		bcc		// blind carbon copied recipients (same format as above)
		subject	// string subject of the email
      attachment // one attachment or array of attachments
	}

## email.SMTP.authentication

associative array of currently supported SMTP authentication mechanisms

## attachment

	// can be called multiple times, each adding a new attachment
	// options is an object with the following possible keys:

    options =
    {
        // one of these fields is required
        path      // string to where the file is located
        data      // string of the data you want to attach
        stream    // binary stream that will provide attachment data (make sure it is in the paused state)
                  // better performance for binary streams is achieved if buffer.length % (76*6) == 0
                  // current max size of buffer must be no larger than Message.BUFFERSIZE

        // optionally these fields are also accepted
        type	      // string of the file mime type
        name        // name to give the file as perceived by the recipient
        charset     // charset to encode attatchment in
        method      // method to send attachment as (used by calendar invites)
        alternative // if true, will be attached inline as an alternative (also defaults type='text/html')
        inline      // if true, will be attached inline
        encoded     // set this to true if the data is already base64 encoded, (avoid this if possible)
        headers     // object containing header=>value pairs for inclusion in this attachment's header
        related     // an array of attachments that you want to be related to the parent attachment
    }
